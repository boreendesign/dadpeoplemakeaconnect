30 Minutes is only 2% of your whole day. 

What exactly does this mean? Let’s break this down.

Everyone has their own unique situations; some people have more; some people have less -- there are so many layers we can go into for what differentiates us on so many levels.

But what do we all have in common - 24 hours!! We all get 24 hours. 

Have you ever sat down at the end of the day and thought to yourself - where has the time gone?  I know I have - and I still do!

One area of life I strive in is troubleshooting and I try to apply solutions to all problems that come my way both personally, professionally and for my nearest and dearest.  Please note the word try!  

Not knowing where your time is going is a problem for me and so it was time for a solution.  I decided to look at what I have and then logged everything I did over 24 hours.

My 24 hours is 100%!

I took everything I did for that 24 hours and turned them into percentages! Let’s go!

Personally I get by on 6 hours sleep so I know that is 25% of my day.

I now have 75% of my day to work with!!  Do you see where I’m going with this?

On average I work for 8 hours a day. This takes another 33% - so 58% of my day is sleep and work. I now have 42% of my day remaining.

I’m so fortunate to work from home so I spend on average 3 hours of my day on Daddy and Husband Duty. This is 13% - add 58% = 71%, I have 29% left!

I used to commute 3 hours daily for work purposes - so understanding a lot of people commute daily, I’m going to add in this percentage as another 13% - so now we are at 84% - we have 16% of our day remaining.

This is where a lot of us lose time. Where we have a choice.  Where you have time for you.

What you do with your remaining percentage is totally up to you.

For me personally for me it is a workout - I block out everything and workout solid for an hour.  

Other days I can use it for mindfulness or just sitting and breathing for a while. 

Being honest I have a great wife and we have a great relationship so I get 4% which is an hour of my day. I use this hour for ME - not work, not family, not other crap that is going on in my head - it’s for ME for what I choose to do for my hour.

The best thing is - after my workout I still have 12% - or 2-3 hours of my day remaining.

So this is your task - log down everything you do over a 24 hour period and how long you spend doing it - change it to percentage and take a look once everything is totalled to 100%.

You’ll me amazed by what you spend your time on, shocked by some it and hopefully as it has done for me, will shift your mindset to realign what is most important for you.
