'Hey pumpkin, can you eat just another few bites', thats how it starts and the next word heard is NO!. So at this moment your thinking to yourself, is she just wanting to run around or is she actually full. So as your saying eat two more spoons your thinking, 'well what if she is full and this is going to cause her to have a bad relationship with food', its a struggle, although a very first world struggle. I have read the impacts on if you handle this badly, it can result in future issues with eating, ok so what about we don't focus on the food and make it a bit more of an experience, ok now we sound crazy but here it goes :-).  

Here are some ideas we have been trying lately, please feel free to share your ideas in the comments.

## 1) Turn off the TV but maybe turn on some music  
We now have a rotating option for me my wife and my daughter to choose what music to listen to. Dinner time starts with 'Alexa can you play ...'. Indigestion can oocur though so be warned, especially when you hear Frozen every 'kids night' on repeat.

## 2) Ask them about their day
If you see the fork being used as an airplane getting really close to their head, its probably that dinner time is getting boring, its time to ask how their day went or for parent(s) to talk about their day.

## 3) Try to play animal or dinosaur :-)
The plane trick is an old one but there is also the option of the kid pretending they are an animal or dinosaur, all kids seem to love dinosaurs for some reason.
