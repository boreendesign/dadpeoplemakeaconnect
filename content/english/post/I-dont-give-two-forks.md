'Hey pumpkin, will eat just another few bites', thats how it starts and the next word heard is NO!. So at this moment your thinking to yourself, is she just wanting to run around or is she actually full. So as your saying eat two more spoons your thinking, 'well what if she is full and this is going to cause her to have a bad relationship with food', its a struggle, although a very first world struggle, I read how you handle this can setup years of issues with eating, ok so what about we don't focus on the food and make it a bit more of an experience, ok now we sound crazy but here it goes :-).  

Here are some ideas we have been trying lately, please feel free to share your ideas in the comments.

## 1) Turn off the TV but maybe turn on some music  
We now have a rotating option for me my wife and my daughter to choose what music to listen to. Dinner time starts with 'Alexa can you play ...'. Indigestion can oocur though so be warned, especially when you hear Frozen every night on repeat but its a good opportunity.
